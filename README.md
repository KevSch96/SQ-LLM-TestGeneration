# SQ-LLM-TestGeneration
This repository accompanies the project work of the group *NullPointerExceptionals* for the course *Software Quality* in the winter semester 2024/25 at the University of Cologne. It contains documentation of the topic regarding LLM-Based Test Case Generation. It presents examplary source code and the respective tests generated by two frameworks that have been used for test generation. A `GPT-3.5 Turbo` large-language model was used to generate the test. As tools we used [Qodo-Cover](https://github.com/qodo-ai/qodo-cover) and [ChatUniTest](https://github.com/ZJU-ACES-ISE/ChatUniTest) as the Maven plug-in. As source code we used some small projects/skripts due to financial and token wise restrictions. Please check out the tests that were generated by the LLM! For further information and the respective report conduct the creators of this repository.

## Course Task

The task for this university project was to investigate and evaluate LLM-based test case generation frameworks for software testing.

## Project Structure

- **`src/`**  
 The src folder includes Java and Python source code, class files, the generated test files, as well as coverage reports produced by Qodo Cover.

- **`screenshots/`**  
  The screenshot folder contains a comprehensive collection of all code snippets and outputs recorded at each stage of the evaluation process for both frameworks. These visual records serve to document the individual steps undertaken during the testing and assessment of Qodo Cover and ChatUniTest.

## Qodo-Cover

For the task of test case generation, we used Qodo Cover, a tool designed to assist with the automated generation of high-quality test cases. Qodo Cover integrates with Large Language Models to streamline the process of creating test cases based on given inputs. It allows us to evaluate different strategies for generating valid test cases and supports the improvement of overall software quality.

## ChatUniTest

ChatUniTest is another tool employed for test case generation. It leverages Large Language Models to automate the production of test cases. ChatUniTest is designed to simplify the generation of comprehensive and accurate test cases, offering an alternative approach to automated testing and contributing to the efficiency and reliability of testing processes.
